# Machine Learning Classification

Supervised machine learning, building and training a neural network to classify images of cats and dogs. Using Google Colab, preprocess the data, train the network, and then use it to classify new images. This end-to-end exercise will give hands-on experience with machine learning workflows, from data handling and model training to evaluationâ€”skills that are fundamental in fields such as autonomous vehicles and computer vision.
