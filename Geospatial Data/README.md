# GeoSpatial Data

Project focuses on working with spatial data. We will create, generate, or sample our own spatial data, perform spatial queries, and visualize both the data and the results of those queries. The exercise will help gain hands-on experience with spatial data formats, geospatial query functions, and visualization techniquesâ€”skills that are valuable in real-world applications and essential for job interviews in fields involving GIS and spatial analysis.
