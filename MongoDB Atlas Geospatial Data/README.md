# MongoDB Atlas Geospatial Data

Hands-on experience working with NoSQL databases, specifically MongoDB, by using JSON data. While the dataset you'll be working with is small, the same techniques and tools apply to much larger datasets, potentially scaling to billions of records. Using MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based version of MongoDB, which eliminates the need for local installation. By working within the free tier, we will have access to a cluster of 3 nodes with 500GB of storage, providing a great environment to explore MongoDB and its capabilities for handling large-scale data.
